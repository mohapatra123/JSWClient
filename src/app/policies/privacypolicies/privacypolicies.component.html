                <p>Data Science Wizards uses the personal information you provide in a manner that is consistent with
                    this Privacy Policy. We use your personal information to provide our services on our Site, including

                    include providing access to our course library, administration of your account, billing, and

                    requested from us, including whitepapers, access to webinars, or the like.</p>
                <p>We also use your personal information together with other personally non-identifiable information to
                    help us better understand our users, to personalize and improve your experience with our Site, and
                    to improve the content and functionality of our Site. This may include providing information about
                    our goods, products, training material and services that we feel may interest you and enhance your

                    newsletters, promotional emails, product updates, or market research requests. We will use your

                    us at the point we collected your information, where required by law, or otherwise in our legitimate
                    interests, provided these interests do not override your right to object to such communications.</p>
                <p><strong>Information we collect about you from your use of our Site:</strong></p>
                <p>We will use this information in our legitimate interests (where we have considered these are not
                    overridden by your rights), to administer our Site, and for internal operations, including
                    troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, and statistical survey purposes. We will also use
                    this information to keep our Site safe and secure, for measuring the effectiveness of how we present
                    content and how we market and advertise. We use Internet protocol addresses and non-personally

                    movements in and around our Site, and to gather demographic information about our user base as a
                    whole. We also utilize artificial intelligence, machine learning technologies and analytics to
                    understand user behaviours and to provide user-specific recommendations and other personalization of
                    our Site experience.&nbsp;</p>
                <p><strong>Information we receive from other sources:</strong></p>
                <p>We will combine this information with information you give to us and information we collect about you
                    in our legitimate interests (where we have considered that these are not overridden by your rights).
                    We will use this information and the combined information for the purposes set out above (depending
                    on the types of information we receive).</p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Who we give your information to</p>
                <p>We consider your personal information to be a vital part of our relationship with you and do not sell
                    your personal information to third parties. There are, however, certain circumstances in which we
                    may share your personal information with certain third parties, as follows:</p>
                <p><strong>Agents, Consultants and Related Third Parties:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>We sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions, such as sending
                    email on our behalf, payment processing, or conducting market research. When we employ another
                    company to perform a function of this nature, we only provide them with the information that they
                    need to perform their specific function. These companies are not permitted to use any personal
                    information that we share with them for any other purpose aside from providing services to us.</p>
                <p>We also share information with third parties about customer engagement on our platform. For example,
                    when you view a course about a technology vendor, we share information such as the number of course
                    minutes viewed, hands-on course engagement, and other related data with that technology vendor. We
                    share this information and receive feedback from those third parties in order to improve the content
                    available on our platform and better collaborate with our partners to jointly help companies and
                    individuals address their skill development needs. Unless we specifically ask for and you grant
                    consent, the data we provide to third parties does not include personal information.</p>
                <p><strong>Business Plans and Company Partnership Subscriptions:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>We partner with certain third parties to provide our services to their employees or their community
                    members. As part of such partnerships, a third party may pay for the subscription for its employees
                    or community members or otherwise contract with Data Science Wizards to make your subscription
                    available to you, and Data Science Wizards may share information about your use of our services with
                    the third party. If your subscription was provided by your employer or community sponsor (including
                    Company Partnerships as defined in the&nbsp;Terms of Use), we may share information you provide, or
                    information we may otherwise collect through your registration and use of our services, with such
                    third party. This information may include course viewing history, course viewing time, course or
                    assessment completion, course quality ratings and feedback, certifications, performance-related
                    metrics, and other personal information.</p>
                <p><strong>Business Transfers:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>As we develop our business, we might sell or buy businesses or assets. Your personal information may
                    be transferred to a buyer or other successor in the event of a corporate sale, merger,
                    reorganization, dissolution, or similar event in which personal information held by us about our
                    Site users is among the assets transferred.</p>
                <p><strong>Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</strong></p>
                <p>This Policy shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Republic of India.
                    Subject to arbitration, the courts at Mumbai shall have exclusive jurisdiction in relation to any
                    disputes arising out of or in connection with this Policy.</p>
                <p>If any dispute arises between the Company and You in connection with or arising out of the validity,
                    interpretation, implementation or alleged breach of any provision of the Policy, such dispute shall
                    be referred to arbitration in accordance with the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 for
                    the time being in force. Arbitration shall be conducted by one (1) arbitrator mutually appointed by
                    the Company and You. The seat of arbitration shall be Mumbai, Maharashtra. The language of the
                    arbitration proceedings and of all written decisions and correspondence relating to the arbitration
                    shall be English.</p>
                <p><strong>Legal Requirements:&nbsp;</strong></p>
                <p>In certain situations, Data Science Wizards may be required to disclose personal information in
                    response to lawful requests by public authorities, including meeting national security or law
                    enforcement requirements. We reserve the right to disclose your personal information as required by
                    law and when we believe that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights or to comply with a
                    judicial proceeding, court order, or similar legal process served on us or our Site.</p>
                <p>We will take reasonable steps to ensure that we only collect that personal information that is
                    relevant for the purposes for which it is to be used. Furthermore, we will not process your personal
                    information in a way that is incompatible with these purposes.</p>

                <p> <strong>Control of your information</strong></p>
                <p>If you would like to discontinue receiving communications from us, you may update your email
                    preferences by using the “Unsubscribe” link found in emails we send to you or by contacting us
                    at&nbsp;datasciencewizards.in. Please note that we may not include the opt-out information in
                    e-mails that are transactional in nature and are not marketing communications (i.e., e-mails
                    concerning your order, the website’s Terms of Use, etc.). You will not have the ability to opt-out
                    of receiving transactional emails. If you have questions or concerns regarding a transactional
                    please contact us.</p>
                <p><strong>How we protect your information</strong></p>
                <p>The security of your personal information is important to us. When you enter sensitive information
                    (such as a credit card number or payment details) on our checkout page, your information is sent
                    over an authenticated and encrypted connection using Transport Layer Security (TLS) through a&nbsp;
                    third party payment gateway.</p>
                <p>We store your personal information only on servers with limited access that are located in controlled
                    facilities and use a variety of technologies and procedures intended to protect your personal
                    information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration and destruction.
                    Nonetheless, no communication via the Internet can ever be 100% secure, and no security measures can
                    ever be assured to be effective. Accordingly, you are advised to use caution and discretion when
                    determining what personal information to disclose to us.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about security on our Site, contact us as follows:</p>

                <p><strong>Links to other websites</strong> </p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to our Site. The Site may contain links to other web sites not
                    operated or controlled by us. The policies and procedures described here do not apply to web sites
                    or other services that Data Science Wizards does not operate or control. These links from our Site
                    do not imply that we endorse or have reviewed those web sites or other services. We suggest
                    contacting those services directly for information on their privacy policies.</p>
                <p><strong>Public forums</strong> </p>
                <p>The Site may, from time to time, make chat rooms, message boards, news groups, or other public forums
                    available to its users, whether by way of our own services or by way of the services or features of
                    a third party. Any information that is disclosed in these areas becomes public information and you
                    should exercise caution when using these areas and avoid posting any personal or sensitive
                    information. If a separate login is required to use these areas, please be aware that you may need
                    to also log out separately.</p>
                <p><strong>Payment processing</strong> </p>
                <p>When you purchase a subscription directly from Data Science Wizards, payment details you provide in
                    the designated checkout page on our Site will be encrypted using the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                    protocol before they are submitted to us over the internet. Payments made on our Site are made
                    through one of our payment gateway providers like PayPal, banks, payment vault (“<strong>Payment
                        Processors</strong>”), which may be changed from time to time. You will be providing credit or
                    debit card information directly to the Payment Processor which operates a secure server to process
                    payment details, encrypting your credit/debit card information and authorizing payment. Information
                    which you supply to the Payment Processor is not within our control and is subject to the Payment
                    Processor’s own privacy policy and terms and conditions.</p>
                <p><strong>Information about enforcement and dispute resolution</strong> </p>
                <p>We will conduct compliance audits of our relevant privacy practices to verify compliance with this
                    Privacy Policy. Any Data Science Wizards employee that we determine has acted in violation of this
                    Privacy Policy will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.

                <p><strong>Changes to this Privacy Policy</strong> </p>
                <p>As our Site evolves, this Privacy Policy will need to evolve as well to cover new situations. To
                    ensure that you are kept informed of changes, check this Privacy Policy periodically as we may or
                    may not update the date at the top of the document any time we make a change. If we make material

                <p><strong>Use of Cookies</strong> </p>
                <p>Data Science Wizards and its affiliates use cookies or similar technologies to collect and store
                    certain information. These typically involve pieces of information or code that a website transfers
                    to or accesses from your computer hard drive or mobile device to store and sometimes track
                    information about you. Cookies allow us to create a unique device ID, enable you to be remembered
                    when using that computer or device to interact with websites and online services, and can be used to
                    manage a range of features and content, including storing searches and presenting personalized
                    content.</p>
                <p>The Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of our Site. This helps us to provide you
                    with a good and personalized user experience when you interact with our Site and also allows us to
                    improve our Site.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but if you prefer, you can change your browser to
                    prevent that. We also give you information about how to disable cookies. However,&nbsp; you may not
                    be able to take full advantage of our Site if you do so.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>A number of cookies we use last only while you are on our Site and expire when you close your browser
                    or exit our Site. Some cookies are used to remember you when you return to our Site and will last
                    for longer. We use these cookies on the basis that they are necessary for the performance of a
                    contract with you, or because using them is in our legitimate interests (where we have considered
                    that these are not overridden by your rights), and, in some cases, where required by law, where you
                    have consented to their use.</p>
                <p><strong>We use the following types of cookies:</strong> </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Strictly necessary cookies.</strong>These are cookies that are required for the
                        operation of our website and under our terms with you. They include, for example, cookies that

                        services.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Analytical/performance cookies.&nbsp;</strong>They allow us to recognize and count the
                        number of visitors and to see how visitors move around our website when they are using it. This
                        helps us for our legitimate interests of improving the way our website works, for example, by
                        ensuring that users are finding what they are looking for easily.&nbsp;</li>
                    <li><strong>Functionality cookies.&nbsp;</strong>These are used to recognize you when you return to
                        our website. These enable us, subject to your choices and preferences, to personalize our

                        or region).</li>
                    <li><strong>Targeting cookies.&nbsp;</strong>These cookies record your visit to our website, the
                        pages you have visited and the links you have followed. We will use this information subject to
                        your choices and preferences to make our Site and the advertising displayed on it more relevant

                </ul>
                <p>We may also work with marketing and advertising networks that gather information about the content on
                    our Site you visit and on information on other websites and services you visit. This may result in

                    services of third parties.</p>
